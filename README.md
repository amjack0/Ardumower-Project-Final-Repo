# Ardumower-Project-Final-Repo
Ardumower is an autonomous mobile robot which can localize and perform autonomous navigation in an outdoor environment. 

# Getting started 
In our lawn mower project, our mobile base is Ardumower which is an open source platform. Now, as our Ardumower is mowing in an outdoor environment which has several problems when comes to localize the Ardumower in lawn. This involves uneven terrain, misalignment of wheels, wheel slipping due to mud and other sensor noise which leads to weak localization of the Ardumower. So in general, we have ‘outdoor problem’, the purpose of stating our ‘outdoor problem’ is that, we can consider the effects of our ‘outdoor problem’ on our Ardumower while performing localization and navigation.
